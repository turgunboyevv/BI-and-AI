    "\n",
    "Before you write any code, grab a pen and paper and sketch out a model of your farm, identifying classes, attributes, and methods. Think about inheritance. How can you prevent code duplication? Take the time to work through as many iterations as you feel are necessary.\n",

    "The actual requirements are open to interpretation, but try to adhere to these guidelines:\n",
    "\n",
    "You should have at least four classes: the parent Animal class, and then at least three child animal classes that inherit from Animal.\n",
    "Each class should have a few attributes and at least one method that models some behavior appropriate for a specific animal or all animals—such as walking, running, eating, sleeping, and so on.\n",
    "Keep it simple. Utilize inheritance. Make sure you output details about the animals and their behaviors."
